It's common to organize events of various kinds over food. It's less
common to consider the dietary restrictions of all invitees. Here, I
summarize my dietary restrictions, for a few reasons:

* Most people don't seem to fully understand what a vegan diet is.
* To normalize the sharing and consideration of dietary restrictions of
  others.

With that said:

* I follow a vegan diet;
* I do not consume meat, or any other animal products;
* I do not consume dairy products like milk, cheese, butter, or any
  derivatives of such;
* I do not consume eggs.

Most everything else is generally fine. I fully understand this can
potentially make finding a location challenging.
